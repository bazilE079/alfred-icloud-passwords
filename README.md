# iCloud Passwords Workflow for Alfred

This workflow allows you to quickly find and copy iCloud passwords and OTPs to your clipboard.

It offers three keywords:

- `f <query>` – Open Preferences and search for the query
- `fp <query>` – Open Preferences, copy the first result's password, and quit
- `otp <query>` – Open Preferences, copy the first result's OTP, and quit

The workflow makes use of AppleScript's accessibility controls, so you might have to give it 
permission to access them the first time you use it.
